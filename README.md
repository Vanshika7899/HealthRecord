# 🏥 Patient Electronic Health Record Using Blockchain


## 📌 Introduction

An **Electronic Health Record (EHR)** is a digital version of a patient’s paper chart that stores comprehensive health information securely. This project develops a **web-based EHR system** using **Blockchain technology** to ensure **data integrity, security, and traceability**.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement

### Challenges in Current EHR Systems:
- Unauthorized data access
- Lack of transparency
- Risk of data tampering
- Inefficient and error-prone manual storage

### 💡 Proposed Solution:
Using **Blockchain** for secure, decentralized storage of patient information, enhancing privacy, accuracy, and reliability of health records.

## 🛠️ Methodology

### 📋 Frontend:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Clean and responsive user interface

### 🔐 Backend:
- Blockchain-based secure storage  
- SHA-256 hashing for generating unique patient Blockchain IDs

---

## 🔄 System Workflow

1. **User** enters patient data (Name, DOB, medical history, etc.)
2. **SHA-256 hash** is generated to create a unique Blockchain ID
3. Data is **securely stored** and retrieved via this ID

---

## ✨ Features

- 🧾 Add Patient: Capture and store patient details securely
- 🔍 View Records: Fetch and display records using Blockchain ID
- 🔐 Tamper-proof and secure data using hashing
- 👩‍⚕️ Assign doctors and maintain patient history

---

## 🧪 Example Output

- Adding Patient  
  - Patient ID: `123`  
  - Blockchain ID: `abc123...`

- Viewing Records  
  - Name: John Doe  
  - DOB: 01/01/2000  
  - History: Diabetes, Asthma

---

## ✅ Advantages

- 🔐 Improved data security & privacy
- 📤 Decentralized storage (no single point of failure)
- 🌐 Easy access for healthcare professionals
- 💾 Prevents unauthorized modification of medical history
